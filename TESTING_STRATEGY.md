# StreamSearch Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for StreamSearch to ensure accuracy and reliability before public release.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Testing
Test individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Recommendation Algorithm Tests
- **Test File**: `__tests__/recommendations.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Cost calculations (monthly/yearly)
  - Service combination optimization
  - Budget constraint handling
  - Edge cases (no shows, unlimited budget)
  - Value optimization logic

#### API Integration Tests
- **Test File**: `__tests__/api.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - TMDB API response parsing
  - Rate limiting functionality
  - Error handling and fallbacks
  - Cache validation

#### localStorage Helper Tests
- **Test File**: `__tests__/storage.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Data persistence and retrieval
  - Cache expiration logic
  - Error handling for storage failures

### 2. Integration Testing
Test component interactions and data flow.

#### User Journey Tests
- Show selection workflow
- Recommendation generation
- Budget constraint scenarios
- API data integration
- Clear data functionality

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Test complete user workflows in a browser environment.

#### Critical User Paths
1. **New User Flow**
   - Landing on homepage
   - Selecting shows from sample data
   - Setting budget preferences
   - Getting recommendations
   - Clearing data

2. **API User Flow**
   - Configuring API keys
   - Searching for shows via API
   - Adding API shows to selection
   - Mixed API/sample data recommendations

3. **Mobile PWA Flow**
   - Installing PWA on mobile
   - Offline functionality
   - Touch interactions
   - Performance on slow connections

### 4. Data Accuracy Testing

#### Streaming Service Data Validation
- **Current Service Prices**: Verify against official websites
- **Service Availability**: Cross-check with JustWatch
- **Show Catalogs**: Validate sample show assignments

#### Algorithm Accuracy
- **Manual Verification**: Test known scenarios with expected outcomes
- **Edge Case Testing**: Empty selections, single service optimal, etc.
- **Cost Calculations**: Verify math for various subscription types

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
- Large show selections (100+ shows)
- Complex service combinations
- API response handling under load

#### Mobile Performance
- PWA install and launch speed
- Touch responsiveness
- Battery usage optimization

### 6. Accessibility Testing

#### Screen Reader Compatibility
- VoiceOver (iOS/macOS)
- TalkBack (Android)
- NVDA (Windows)

#### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order and focus management
- Keyboard-only operation
- Custom component accessibility

#### Visual Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Text size and readability
- High contrast mode support

### 7. Browser Compatibility Testing

#### Desktop Browsers
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

#### Mobile Browsers
- iOS Safari
- Chrome Mobile
- Firefox Mobile
- Samsung Internet

### 8. Security Testing

#### Data Privacy
- No personal data collection
- API key security
- localStorage data protection

#### API Security
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Error message information disclosure
- CORS configuration

## Testing Tools and Setup

### Test Framework
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright @playwright/test
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
npm install --save-dev lighthouse
```

## Test Data

### Sample Test Scenarios
1. **Budget Constraint Test**
   - Selected shows available across multiple services
   - Budget that requires service optimization
   - Expected: Minimum cost combination within budget

2. **No Coverage Test**
   - Selected shows not available on any service
   - Expected: Clear messaging about unavailability

3. **Perfect Match Test**
   - Selected shows all available on single service
   - Expected: Single service recommendation

4. **Value Optimization Test**
   - Shows spread across multiple services
   - Optimize for value enabled
   - Expected: Fewer services prioritized over cost

## Manual Testing Checklist
